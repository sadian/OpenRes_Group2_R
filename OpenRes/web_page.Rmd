### Research Question 1:
#### What are the general participation patterns, basic statistics?


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("tibble")
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# read data
total = read.csv(file.choose(), header =T)  
# list what file you picked manually, hard to remember which file you choosed...
total = read.csv("C:/Users/Sadia/Desktop/OpenRes/ResponseTotal.csv")
AMLPS = read.csv("C:/Users/Sadia/Desktop/OpenRes/AMLPS_RESP_2017_17112017134913689.csv")
female = read.csv("C:/Users/Sadia/Desktop/OpenRes/ResponseFemale.csv")
male = read.csv("C:/Users/Sadia/Desktop/OpenRes/ResponseMale.csv")
str(female)


# Check the states data
# get rid of duplicates
AMLPS = distinct(AMLPS)
female = distinct(female)
male = distinct(male)
total = distinct(total)
